# Background-Click Supervision for Temporal Action Localization

This repository is the official implementation of BackTAL. In this work, we study the temporal action localization under background-click supervision, and find the performance bottleneck of the existing approaches mainly comes from the background errors. Thus, we convert existing action-click supervision to the background-click supervision and develop a novel method, called BackTAL. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks are conducted, which demonstrate the high performance of the established BackTAL and the rationality of the proposed background-click supervision.

### Background-Click Annotations

The raw annotations of THUMOS14 dataset are under directory './data/THUMOS14/human_anns'.

## Evaluation

### Pre-trained Models

You can download checkpoints for Thumos14,  ActivityNet1.2 and HACS dataset from [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/19at079XNqu0PWc17YrN3Pw) with code ```back```. These models are trained on Thumos14,  ActivityNet1.2 or HACS using the configuration file under the directory "./experiments/". Please put these checkpoints under directory "./checkpoints".

### Evaluation

Before running the code, please activate the conda environment.

To evaluate BackTAL model on Thumos14, run:

```eval
cd ./tools
python eval.py -dataset THUMOS14 -weight_file ../checkpoints/THUMOS14.pth
```
To evaluate BackTAL model on ActivityNet1.2, run:

```eval
cd ./tools
python eval.py -dataset ActivityNet1.2 -weight_file ../checkpoints/ActivityNet1.2.pth
```

To evaluate BackTAL model on HACS, run:

```eval
cd ./tools
python eval.py -dataset HACS -weight_file ../checkpoints/HACS.pth
```
